# Sales Analytics Dashboard – Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from **Ferns N Petals (FNP)**, an online gifting company, using **Excel Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX**.  
The goal was to build an **interactive dashboard** that updates in real time based on **slicer and timeline selections**, allowing stakeholders to explore sales performance across occasions, products, cities, and time periods.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Power Query** → Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Power Pivot** → Data modeling with star schema relationships  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** → Calculated columns and measures for KPIs  
- **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts** → Data aggregation and visualization  
- **Slicers & Timelines** → Interactive filtering across occasions, cities, and dates
